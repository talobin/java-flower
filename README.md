# java-flower
Java version of Google's SunFlower project

Note: This repo won't be actively updated as much as the SunFlower project.

This is project for those who wants to learn Jetpack and best Practices from Google but in Java.
It is also good way for Java developer to learn Kotlin as this is intended to be the direct translation of the Kotlin SunFlower project.

Any contribution is more than welcome.
